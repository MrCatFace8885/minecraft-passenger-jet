# minecraft-passenger-jet
A fully functional passenger airplane I made in Minecraft, with redstone and slime blocks.

I'm not sure if a GitHub was the best way to host a world download, but it works I guess.

# Installation instructions
Move the directory "Minecraft airplane" into the saves directory in .minecraft, and launch the game. The world should be listed in your singleplayer worlds.
